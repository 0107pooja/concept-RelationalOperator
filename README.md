In Java, relational operators are used to compare two values and determine the relationship between them. 
The following relational operators are available in Java:

1. < (less than) = This checks whether the first operand is less than the second operand or not.
        eg=     int a = 10;
                int b = 20;
                if (a < b) {
                System.out.println("a is less than b");
                }


2. > (greater than) = This checks whether the first operand is greater than the second operand or not.
        eg=     int a = 30;
                int b = 20;
                if (a > b) {
               System.out.println("a is greater than b");
               } 


3. <= (less than or equal to) = This checks whether the first operand is less than or equal to the second operand or not.
        eg=     int a = 20;
                 int b = 20;
                 if (a <= b) {
                 System.out.println("a is less than or equal to b");
                 }


4. = (greater than or equal to) = This checks whether the first operand is greater than or equal to the second operand or not.
         eg=     int a = 30; 
                 int b = 20;
                 if (a >= b) {
                 System.out.println("a is greater than or equal to b");
                 }


5. == (equal to) =This operator is used to check whether the two given operands are equal or not. 

         eg=     int a = 30;
                 int b = 30;
                 if (a == b) {
                 System.out.println("a is equal to b");
                  }

6. != (not equal to) = This operator is used to check whether the two given operands are equal or not.
                       It functions opposite to that of the equal-to-operator.

         eg=     int a = 30;
                 int b = 20;
                 if (a != b) {
                  System.out.println("a is not equal to b");
                   }
